Myxer is a lightweight, powerful Volume Mixer built with modern UI design for a seamless user experience. Devices, Streams, and even Card profiles can all be managed with Myxer, providing a complete replacement for your system Volume Mixer.

Myxer fits seamlessly into your stock applications, and PulseAudio panel plugins can easily be configured to open it when you click "Audio Mixer."

Individual audio channels can be shown, and Audio Card profiles can be configured. There's no need for pavucontrol anymore.
