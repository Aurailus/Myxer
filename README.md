Myxer is a lightweight, powerful Volume Mixer built in Rust, that uses modern UI design to create a seamless user experience. Inputs, Outputs, Playback Streams, and Recording streams can all be managed with Myxer, giving you complete control over your system audio.

### Responsive

Myxer adapts to your selected GTK theme so that it fits seamlessly into your stock applications.

Additionally, PulseAudio plugin can be easily configured to open Myxer when you click the "Audio Mixer" entry on the popup menu, so it can behave like a stock app, too!

### Advanced

Behind the context menu you can find options to show individual audio channels, and even configure Audio Card profiles in the App. There's no need to pavucontrol anymore.

### Building

Download the repository, and Cargo, and then simply run `cargo build --release` in the root directory.

Major releases are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Aurailus/Myxer/releases) page. If you want something more breaking edge, you can download an artifact of the lastest commit [here](https://nightly.link/Aurailus/myxer/workflows/release/master/Myxer.zip). These artifacts are untested, YMMV.

#### Building for Development 

Call `cargo run`, (or `nodemon`, if you have that installed) in the root directory, and watch it go.

### Contributing
