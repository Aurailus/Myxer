# Myxer
A modern Volume Mixer for PulseAudio, built using Rust.

## Developing
Just use `cargo run`, ( or `./nodemon` if you have it installed), that's it. 

## Building
Use `cargo build --release` in the root directory.

## Disclaimer
This project is *very* early in development, there are bugs and unfinished features! Use at your own risk. I'm very new to Rust as well, so there may be inefficiencies or other strange behavior that I haven't caught. Please file an issue if you find a problem.

## Contributing
Pull Requests are welcome and appreciated. If you're unsure of whether a feature will be accepted, open an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
