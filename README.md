## Building

Use `cargo build --release` in the root directory.

Major releases are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Aurailus/Myxer/releases) page. If you want something more breaking edge, you can download an artifact of the lastest commit [here](https://nightly.link/Aurailus/myxer/workflows/release/master/Myxer.zip). These artifacts are untested, YMMV.

## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome and appreciated. If you're unsure of whether a feature will be accepted, open an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.  

### Building for Development

Just use `cargo run`, (or `nodemon ./`, if you have that installed) in the root directory, that's it.
