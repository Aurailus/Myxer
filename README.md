Myxer is a lightweight, powerful Volume Mixer built with modern UI design for a seamless user experience. Devices, Streams, and even Card profiles can all be managed with Myxer, providing a complete replacement for your system Volume Mixer.

### Adaptive

Myxer adapts to your selected GTK theme so that it fits seamlessly into your stock applications.

Additionally, one can easily configure PulseAudio panel plugins to open Myxer when you click the "Audio Mixer" entry on the popup menu so that it behaves like a stock app, too!

### Advanced

Behind the context menu, there are options to show individual audio channels and even configure Audio Card profiles. There's no need for pavucontrol anymore.
